# speakout.io

**Hello**

Welcome to my beta project for SpeakOut. 

**Update as of May 14, 2019**

This version does not fully work at the moment due to a server configuration bug üêõ. I will be restructuring the code soon and hope to release a fully working version over the summer.

**What It Is**

SpeakOut is a tool for broadcasting speeches at protests using mobile devices. It runs in the browser using WebRTC, requiring no native app download.

**How It Works**

This is built for a tight use case with Transportation Alternatives.
* One person speaks into their phone.
* Other people's phones amplify that audio over a wider space, without the need for a sound system.

**Note Before Using This Code**

This is a beta version. Check the Issues above to see what needs to be fixed before deploying in other demonstration contexts, and what features I'm thinking of adding.

**Collaborating**

I‚Äôm interested in collaborating! This can look like working together on the design and back-end of SpeakOut and similar projects. I‚Äôm also open to testing SpeakOut in new demonstrations contexts. You can find my contact information on my website.
