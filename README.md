**Hello**
Welcome to my beta project for SpeakOut.

**What It Is**
SpeakOut is a tool for broadcasting speeches at protests using mobile devices. It runs in the browser using WebRTC, requiring no native app download.

**How It Works**
This is built for a tight use case with Transportation Alternatives.
* One person speaks into their phone.
* Other people's phones amplify that audio over a wider space, without the need for a sound system.

**Note Before Using This Code**
This is a beta version. It has some vulnerabilities that need to be dealt with before deploying in other protest or demonstration contexts.
