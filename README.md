Hello, welcome to my beta project for SpeakOut.

*What It Is*
SpeakOut is a tool for broadcasting speeches at protests using mobile devices. It runs in the browser using WebRTC, requiring no native app download.

*How It Works*
⋅⋅* One person speaks into their phone.
⋅⋅* Other people's phones amplify that audio over a wider space, without the need for a sound system.

*Background*
This is built for a tight use case with Transportation Alternatives.

*Using This Code*
This is a beta version. It has some vulnerabilities that need to be dealt with before deploying in other protest or demonstration contexts.
